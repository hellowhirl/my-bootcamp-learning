Object-oriented Programming

OOP: a programming paradigm centered around objects rather than functions
- it's not a language or tool
- supported by Ruby, JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, and more

- Before OOp there was procedural programming (too much interdepency)

- In OOP we combine a group of related variables and functions into a unit - an object with properties and methods

4 pillars of OOP

Encapsulation
 - Combine a group of related variables and functions that operate on them into a unit - an object with properties and methods

Abstraction
 - hide details and complexity and show only essentials; reduce complexity + isolate impact of changes

Inheritance
 - remove redundant code by defining once in a generic object

Polymorphism
 - method behaves differently depending on the object we are referencing; refactor ugly case/switch or if/eles statements
