// React notes

// Each component is a piece of UI - build them separately and put together to build complex UI'separately
// React elements are just JS objects that maps to a DOM elements (just represents DOM elememnt in memory)

// Don't need to write code to query and manipulate DOM or attach event handlers to DOM elements


// Both below are similar in component based architecture;
// Angular is a complete solution framework
// Reach is simply a library that handles the View - making sure view is in sync with the state

// create-react-app
// installs Web Development Server, Webpack, Babel
// zero config setup - but possible with running command "npm run eject"

// JSX: JavaScript XML
// Babel converts JSX code to browswer readable JavaScript

// id="root" is container for our React app

- react-scripts:

"start": "react-scripts start", // start dev server
"build": "react-scripts build", // build application for production for optimized pacckage
"test": "react-scripts test", // for running unit tests
"eject": "react-scripts eject" // eject from create-react app and customize configs for this project

- all the complex configs (babel, webpack, etc.) are hidden

*only use if you know what you're doing*
    npm run eject
- this will make all dependencies visible and you can also see 'config' folder


- Full-stack: JavaScript / Node + Express + MongoDB
